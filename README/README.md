In the next page, you can learn about Africanfuturism, another genre of Black Speculative Fiction that centers more around the African experience.
On the "Diasporic Roles" page, you can see how people of the African Diaspora contribute to these genres in differing and similar ways.

In the "Explore" page, you can learn what type of Afrofuturist, Africanfuturist, or Africanjujuist work you can check out to experience and learn more about the genres.
You can pick any combination from the categories of genre, time period, theme, and medium to get a unique result. (Note: if your result is just a series of letters, I did not have time to research and input a suggestion yet.)
